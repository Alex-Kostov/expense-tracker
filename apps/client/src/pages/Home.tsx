// TODO: Summary Cards
//     Display key financial metrics like total income, total expenses, and the current balance prominently on the homepage.
//     Use cards or sections to separate these metrics for easy reading.

// TODO: Transaction List:
//     Show a list of recent transactions, including their date, description, amount, and category.
//     Use pagination or infinite scrolling to allow users to browse through their transactions if there are many.

// TODO: Income and Expense Charts:
//     Create visual charts or graphs that illustrate the breakdown of income and expenses over a specified time period.
//     Pie charts, bar charts, or line charts can be used to represent this data.
